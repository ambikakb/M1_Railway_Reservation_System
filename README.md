# INTRODUCTION

*  Railway ticket booking system is implemented by C programming.
*  It is as same as one can see while we are going for online ticket booking. 
*  The following series of steps are being followed while booking a railway ticket in this software.
*  The first step is to provide the total number of passengers and submit all the necessary details of the passengers.
*  The next step is to enter the source and destination.
*  A list of available trains will appear. Among them, the user has to choose one.
*  The ticket value will be evaluated. The system will ask to enter the seat choice by showing the seat matrix. At last, a receipt will be generated on the screen.

## OBJECTIVE
* To do railway reservation for the passengers
